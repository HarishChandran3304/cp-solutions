# Substrings without Vowels
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. Given a string S and an integer n, write a code to generate all substrings of length n without vowels. For example, if the given string S1 is ‘apple’ then substrings of S1 of length 3 are app, ppl, pple. And substrings of length 3 without vowels is only one and it is ppl.

## Boundary Conditions

length of the string s <=20 without spaces

n>0 and n<length of s

There is atleast one substring of length n without vowels

## Input Format

First line contains a string, S in lower case

Next line contains an integer, n

## Output Format

Print substrings of length n without vowels

One substring in one line
